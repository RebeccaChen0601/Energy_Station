An Energy Station App to support people with mental health problems

Introduction:
This App sets up a daily to-do list for at most 5 positive things for users to accomplish. The users can light up the star on the task card when they finish a task. The more tasks they do, the more energy they will get. Their energy is accumulated. 10000 energy points can be converted to $10. The fund will be automatically donated to Canadian Mental Health organizations.
